# Frontend

Hi there!

If you're new to this field, just like me, I’d like to welcome you to my frontend repository.

I’ve recently started adding my mini web projects to my GitHub account. Some of these projects are my own designs, while others are inspired by designs I found randomly on social media.

The repository is organized into two folders: one for JavaScript-based projects and one for other web mini projects. If you’d like to see these projects online, you can either click on "Index.html" in the main repository or go to each project folder and click on the file named "link" to view them hosted on GitHub.

For more information or to get in touch, you can email me at:
